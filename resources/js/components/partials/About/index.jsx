                        Hello! My name is Hadi Nurhidayat. I am very interested
                        in web development, starting in 2020. I first became
                        interested because, when I worked at an insurance
                        company, I was given the challenge of creating a
                        website-based employee productivity system by my boss.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since then, I have started to relearn the basics of web
                        programming, such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not only that, I also attended a bootcamp to deepen my
                        skills in the world of web development .Until now, I
                        have worked at Indocyber Global Technology as a
                        full-stack developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The skills that I currently master are: Javascript,
                        ReactJS, Node.js, Laravel, and VueJS
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div className="col-span-1">right</div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
};
